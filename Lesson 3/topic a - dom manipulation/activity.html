<!--Scenario: Your team is building an email website. The site needs to load the userâ€™s email data from a JSON file and dynamically populate a table with the email data loaded. The emails are provided in the example code file. The email table should show the from, to, and subject fields and have a row for each email. Use the emails object to build the email table in the DOM through the DOM manipulation learned in this chapter.-->
